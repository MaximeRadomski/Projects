- Devlo 04
Hi, before really starting this video, I have to thank all of you who gave me feedbacks on the alpha version of the game after the last devlog. it is a wonderful feeling to see people giving interest onto my work, after months of work having just my house spiders as testers !


Well, it covers pretty much what I have been doing recently.
See ya next time
