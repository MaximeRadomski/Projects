[IN PROGRESS]

Old but maybe still present bugs:
? looks like the bug where harddropping and bring up menu at the same time causes the game to not pause is still there
? Mobile only: In input on the left side, if you set something to the top-middle and go back, it'll disappear. I've not tested top-left or top-right. You have to set it again for it to stay.
? I think theres the bug with when you lock a piece in then pause the game it still plays in the background
? button info stepsScenes doesn't handle 144Hz very well

ToDo List:

- I just died while I was in the menu. I wanted to switch to window mode, but when I came back, before I could press 'resume', I heard the death sound and got the message telling me my chance of rare stuff had increased. Here's the items I had, if it helps. The piece that was on screen when I paused was a 6 block arrow shaped piece, with +1 block from Pentagram and +1 block from the last enemy's attack (some angel because it was the Seed of Light tattoo encounter)
- link settings to an account
