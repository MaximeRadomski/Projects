[IN PROGRESS]

Bug:
? looks like the bug where harddropping and bring up menu at the same time causes the game to not pause is still there
? Mobile only: In input on the left side, if you set something to the top-middle and go back, it'll disappear. I've not tested top-left or top-right. You have to set it again for it to stay.
? I think theres the bug with when you lock a piece in then pause the game it still plays in the background
? button info stepsScenes doesn't handle 144Hz very well

New Features:
- also soft-drop arr and das would be pog too
- free trainning start at level

Currently working on:
- More invisible pieces and vision block attacks
- One hell opponent per new attacks
- One earth opponent per new attacks
