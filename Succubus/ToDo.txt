[TODO]

- https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlyspecific/
- Music Loop (make it better somehow)
- All Realms Panels
- Add a lot of effects
- Settings Vibration
	- Audio settings becomes Audio & Vibration
	- Gameplay settings becomes Gamepay
- Overblend start and end positions
	- Add Overblends when necessary (step -> classic -> step)
	- Or maybe not... Let's keey the oveblend for the menus and stuff like that. Let's use a combat encounter animation like in smash bros :D
- Half Zones
- Sound Tattoo Inked
- Sound Item Looted + animation
- Create your opponent
- Attack which change your current piece
- Attack which rotate your current piece
- Attacks that drasticly reduce the fps
- Attacks that invoke a small cube in the playfield, that add a row on each locked piece that doesn't step over it
- Attack which create a small random offset on each of the playfield blocks

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[IN PROGRESS]

- Make items and passives relative to last attacks (counters, things like that)
