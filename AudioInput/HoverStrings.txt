Valid Hz Offset:
the required offset around a frequency for it to be valid.
note: lower frequencies tend to be less precise.

Required Frames:
how much frames with the same frequency should be needed to validate a frequency.
few frames means a faster reactivity but a bad precision.
more frames means the opposite.

Peaks Priority:
when for two inputs with the same frequency but different peaks, should the one with a higher or lower number of peaks should be prioritized.
example: the current detected frequency is 71.37 hz with 4 peaks, but you have two inputs with 71.37 hz, one with 3 peaks, the other one with 5.

Popup Number Question Mark:
                    supported keys:
          numbers: <material="3x5.1.2.3">'0' to '9'</material>
          minus: <material="3x5.1.2.3">'-' or 'm'</material>
          period: <material="3x5.1.2.3">'.' or 'p'</material>

level dynamic range and gain:
<material="3x5.1.2.3">level</material>
adjust dynamic range and gain until the caught level is under the recording area when you don't play, and doesn't go over it when you play loud

spectrum dynamic range and gain:
<material="3x5.1.2.3">spectrum</material>
adjust dynamic range and gain until there are no peaks when you don't play, and a consistent amount of peaks when you play your notes
